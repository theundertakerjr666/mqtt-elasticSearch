#this program requires the script to be run on the same server as you
#have elasticsearch running
#change the server and port data according to your installation
#the program is simple, but should work fine for testing
#the program will cope with a mixture of string and numeric data
#however it would be wise to develop further if a variety of data types
#such as json is to be used
